# Groove Salad vs. the Game
Changes stuff, or whatever?
## Item Reworks
Reworks and rebalances for 16 items. 

Focuses on building up unfun or overly weak items to increase item variety without raising the player's power ceiling.

The current scope is only standard items, but boss, lunar, and void items may be included in the future. 

## Stronger Monsters
Buffs many 'basic' monsters like Beetles, Lemurians, and Lesser Wisps.

Beetles gain a new 'Burrow' skill.

Also includes some minor director tweaks.
